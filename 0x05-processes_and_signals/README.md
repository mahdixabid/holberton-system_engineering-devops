# 0x05 Processes and signals :wrench:

> Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers processes and signals

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* What is a PID
* What is a process
* How to find a processâ€™ PID
* How to kill a process
* What is a signal
* What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored
